## Unsolved Problems:
* We want to add functionality where a 'Correct!' or 'Try again!' message show up based on the users answer choice. We have some functionality for this where messages are displayed in the console but were unable to complete this function.

## Group Member Roles:
* Group Members: Meg MacIver, Stella Gordon-Zigel and Charles Wilner
* As a group we developed the layout of the app, created an MVP and decided on our component structure.
* As a group we decided to use the feature branch git workflow.
* The group members worked together to create the main components of the front-end:
       * Charles built the Home component paired with the SubjectBox component that renders within.
       * Meg built the Lessons component paired with the LessonBox component that renders within.
       * Stella built the Lesson component paired with the QuestionBox component that renders within.       
* Stella and Meg contributed to the front-end CRUD functionality.
       * Stella took the helm on the front-end CRUD functionality and worked with Meg to get those functions working in junction with the back-end.
* Stella and Charles contributed to the styling of the app.
